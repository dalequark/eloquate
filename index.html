    This week Google’s AlphaGo beat world champion Lee Sedol in four of five games of Go, almost exactly twenty years after Deep Blue beat Kasparov at chess. If we had any hope left that humans might retain dominance in some logic-based game, it’s been dashed thanks to the ever-expanding grasp of artificial intelligence. And if computers beating human beings at board games no longer impresses us, consider all of the more organic problems that machines have learned to solve. We take for granted that computers are able to identify faces in photographs, recognize handwritten digits on checks, detect credit card fraud — these are problems that have been “solved” by machine learning. And so, as an engineer at OkCupid, I can’t help but wonder what a world would look like in which dating has been “solved” by artificial intelligence.
    What would that even mean? Every day Amazon learns to better predict which products we’ll buy. Spotify finds us better music recommendations. In a hypothetical/utopian future where dating is solved by computers, the recommendations of our dating apps will be so incisive that we’ll take for granted the optimality of algorithmic love-finding. Organic dating au natural will come to seem like an extortionate waste of time.
    Now it’s unlikely computers will be able to capture all of the complexities of love in a single algorithm, but what I hope for in the future of online dating — what I’ll consider a success akin to Google’s AlphaGo — is an app so intelligent that almost every date it recommends me will be a good one. To be precise, I’ll say that an algorithm is a near-perfect dating algorithm when nine in ten of the dates it recommends are so good that they turn into second dates.
    As far off as this future may be, I spend lots of time thinking about what challenges lie between today’s OkCupid and tomorrow’s ExcellentCupid. What technical hurdles stand between our current matching algorithms and tomorrow’s near-perfect ones? What are the theoretical bounds on how well we can compute love, and what steps must we take to meet them?
